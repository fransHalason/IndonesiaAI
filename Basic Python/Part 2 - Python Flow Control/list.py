PYTHON: LIST

They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.
'''
mylist = [1,2,3,4]
print(mylist)
print(mylist[2])

mylist1 = []
mylist1.append(1)
mylist1.append(2)
mylist1.append(3)
# print(mylist1)

# print(mylist1[0]) # prints 1
# print(mylist1[1]) # prints 2
# print(mylist1[2]) # prints 3

# prints out 1,2,3
for x in mylist1:
    print(x)
