'''
PYTHON: USER INPUT

Python allows for user input.
That means we are able to ask the user for input as a string.
'''

name = input("Enter name: ")
print("Your name is", name)
print("Your name is " + name)
print("Your name is {}".format(name))
print(f"Your name is {name}")

x = 15
y = 10

print(x, y)
