PYTHON: OBJECTS

An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

# Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
class myclass:
    x = 5

object = myclass()
print(object.x)
